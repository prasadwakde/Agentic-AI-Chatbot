TITLE: LangChain Basics – Chains, Tools, and Agents

1. What is LangChain?

LangChain is a framework for building LLM-powered applications.
It focuses on:
- Composing LLM calls with other components (tools, memory, retrieval, etc.).
- Providing abstractions to build chatbots, RAG systems, and agents.


2. Chains

A chain is a sequence (or directed graph) of steps that process inputs using LLMs and other components.

Examples:
- PromptTemplate → LLM → OutputParser
- Retrieval → LLM → Answer

Chains help organize logic, making it easier to reuse and test components.


3. Tools

Tools are functions that the model can call to perform actions in the outside world, such as:
- Web search
- Database queries
- File operations
- Code execution

In LangChain:
- A tool typically wraps a Python function and describes its input schema.
- Tools extend the capabilities of the LLM beyond text-only reasoning. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}


4. Agents

Agents use an LLM to decide:
- Which tool(s) to call
- In what order
- When to stop and respond

Typical loop:
1) User query → agent.
2) LLM decides next action:
   - Use a tool (“call web_search with query …”), or
   - Provide final answer.
3) If a tool is called:
   - Tool executes and returns observation.
   - Observation is fed back into the agent.
4) Repeat until a final answer is produced.

Agents enable dynamic decision-making: the chain is not fixed ahead of time but constructed step-by-step by the LLM. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}


5. Memory

Memory components store conversational state across turns.
They allow:
- Incorporating previous user messages into the context.
- Maintaining long-running interactions.


6. RAG in LangChain

LangChain includes integrations for:
- Vector stores (Chroma, FAISS, Qdrant, etc.).
- Embedding models.

Typical RAG chain:
- Retriever (vector store) → LLM with context.

An agent can combine:
- Retrieval tools.
- Web search tools.
- Domain-specific tools (e.g., calculator, SQL database).


7. Why LangChain?

- Standardized abstractions over LLMs, tools, and workflows.
- Integrations with many providers and databases.
- Good starting point for building complex LLM apps.
