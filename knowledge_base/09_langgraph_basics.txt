TITLE: LangGraph Basics – State, Nodes, Edges, and Tools

1. What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a library (from the LangChain ecosystem) for building stateful, graph-based LLM workflows and agents.

Key idea:
Represent your application as a graph:
- Nodes: units of work (LLM calls, tool calls, custom code).
- Edges: transitions between nodes (fixed or conditional).
- State: shared data structure passed and updated as the graph runs. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}


2. State

State is a structured object that carries information between nodes.
It can include:
- Messages (conversation history).
- Intermediate tool results.
- Metadata (user ID, flags, etc.).

Nodes read from and write to this shared state.


3. Nodes

A node is typically a Python function that:
- Takes the current state as input.
- Produces an updated state (or partial update).

Types of nodes:
- LLM node: calls an LLM using context and prompts from the state.
- Tool node: executes tools such as web search, retrieval, or custom APIs.
- Control node: manages branching or aggregation.


4. Edges

Edges connect nodes and define control flow.

Types:
- Normal edges:
    Always go from one node to another (fixed sequence).
- Conditional edges:
    Choose the next node based on the state (e.g., if the LLM requested a tool call, go to tool node; otherwise, end). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

Conditional edges are powerful for building agents that decide their next steps dynamically.


5. Building an Agent with LangGraph (High-Level Steps)

Typical steps:
1) Define the state schema.
2) Define tools.
3) Define LLM node(s).
4) Define tool node(s).
5) Define logic that decides when to call tools and when to stop.
6) Use StateGraph to connect nodes and edges.
7) Compile the graph into a runnable agent.

This allows complex flows such as:
- Loops (e.g., repeatedly call tools until some condition).
- Branches (e.g., different paths depending on user input).
- Multi-step workflows with persistent state. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}


6. Tools and Integration with LangChain

LangGraph agents often reuse:
- LangChain LLM wrappers.
- LangChain tools and retrievers.

You can use LangGraph alone or together with LangChain:
- LangChain: primitives (chains, tools, retrievers).
- LangGraph: higher-level control flow and stateful orchestration.


7. Advantages of LangGraph

- Explicit, debuggable control flow (graphs instead of opaque loops).
- Built-in support for persistence and streaming.
- Good fit for complex multi-step agents and workflows (e.g., customer support bots, research agents).
